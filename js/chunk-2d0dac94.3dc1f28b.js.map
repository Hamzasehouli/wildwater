As climate change and other\r\n          environmental issues take center stage and impact all areas of our\r\n          lives, Wildwater is committed and taking initiatives to reduce its\r\n          environmental footprint. In an effort to preserve the attributes of\r\n          nature and to guarantee the purity of the water, the company has\r\n          established a security perimeter of 140 ha of land around the sources\r\n          of saint mountain source, protecting them from all polluting human\r\n          activities. This initiative was also accompanied by regular awareness\r\n          sessions with surrounding populations on the risk of underground\r\n          pollution linked to the use of pesticides in agriculture.\r\n        </p></template\r\n      >\r\n    </content-cmp>\r\n  </main>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nimport { reactive, onMounted } from \"vue\";\r\nexport default {\r\n  setup() {\r\n    const obj = reactive({\r\n      title: `Environment`,\r\n      para: \"Water is nature's most precious gift and it is essential to preserve it.\",\r\n      path: \"url('images/envir.jpg')\",\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    onMounted(function () {\r\n      document.title = \"Environment\";\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return { obj };\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n","import { render } from \"./Environment.vue?vue&type=template&id=4ba3b05a\"\nimport script from \"./Environment.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./Environment.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nscript.render = render\n\nexport default script"],"sourceRoot":""}
